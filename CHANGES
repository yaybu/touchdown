Changelog for Touchdown
=======================

0.0.5 (2015-03-04)

- Brown paper bag.


0.0.3 (2015-02-26)
------------------

- The CloudFront abstraction has been revisited to flatten and simplify the

------------------

- Basic support for Amazon SQS.

- Basic support for Amazon SNS.

- Basic support for Amazon CloudFront Streaming Distributions.

- Pipeline sbould now be able to create one.

- Strings fields are now validated against their annotations:

    * `min` enforces a minimum length for a value
    * `max` enforces a maximum length for a value
    * `choices` enforces that the value is one of a pre-determined list
    * `regex` enforces that the value matches a guard expression

- More types now have proper ``signature`` annotations for their ``Apply``
  policy. For example, you will now be warned at plan time if a
  SecurityGroup doesn't have the required ``description`` field (#10).
