- AWS LaunchConfiguration: Fix regression where json_user_data field stops
  user_data field from working.


0.15.6 (2016-09-13)
-------------------

- VPC: Support VPC Endpoints. These allow private network interfaces to access
  S3 without needing NAT etc.

- KMS: Fix key deletion.

- Core: progressbar2 integration has been removed.

- Windows: Fix unix epoch handling in AWS CloudWatch log tailing.

- Core: Fix some issues around pending resources that could break very early on
  for **fresh** deployments (from scratch).

- Config: Fix a case where a key is present but has no value breaking things.


0.15.5 (2016-08-24)
-------------------

- Core: Various serialization fixes regarding detection of 'pending' resources.


0.15.4 (2016-08-24)
-------------------

- Provisioner: Provisioner explicitly does not participate in destroy goals.

- AWS EC2: Wait for EC2 instance to be properly terminated


0.15.3 (2016-08-24)
-------------------

- AWS Events: Clean up targets before trying to delete rules.


0.15.2 (2016-08-16)
-------------------

- AWS EC2: Support `user_data` for ec2 instances.


0.15.1 (2016-08-15)
-------------------

- AWS EBS: Fix validation for volume_attachments. Certain operations expected
  it to have a name, which is not the case.

- SSH: Fix portforward cmd line entry point, which was incorrectly parsing port
  specifications.

- Core: Some graph walking helpers were added to help testing.


0.15.0 (2016-08-12)
-------------------

- AWS STS: Add `touchdown get-credentials ROLENAME`. This allows touchdown to
  generate some temporary credentials and set them in the environment. The goal
  of this feature is that you will be able to do this:

    $ eval `touchdown get-credentials ROLE`
    $ (deployment) awscli s3 sync ....

  But for now the progress bar is also on stdout which stops this working.

- AWS EC2: Add support for attaching EBS Volumes to EC2 Instances.

- AWS EC2: Touchdown now waits after creating a Volume before trying to use it
  with other resources.

- SSH: Basic portforwarding rules can now be attached to SSH connections:

    ssh_connection.add_port_forward(
        name='db',
        hostname='localhost',
        port=5432,
    )

  This will allow you to connect to port 5432 on localhost (relative to the
  machine you have SSH'd to) with:

      touchdown portfwd db=8093

  (In this case, port 8093 on your local machine will forward to port 5432 on
  the remote machine).


0.14.3 (2016-08-04)
-------------------

- AWS: Wait for password policy changes to be correctly applied.


0.14.2 (2016-08-04)
-------------------

- EBS: Add support for creating/destroying EBS volumes.

- S3: Fix an issue with notification configuration for new buckets.

- AWS: Fix password policy creation.


0.14.1 (2016-07-15)
-------------------

- Provisioner: Flag to make planning simpler

- Provisioner: If ASG isn't available task is run

- Provisioner: Fix SSHing where target changes between planning and execution


0.14.0 (2016-06-23)
-------------------

- Add initial support for WAF. This can be used to restrict access by IP or
  block access to parts of a site by URI, headers or query string.

- Rework Lambda deployment code - especially when using a local fuselage bundle.


0.13.1 (2016-06-14)
-------------------

- Turn on CloudWatch-backed tailing for AWS Lambda functions.


0.13.0 (2016-06-13)
-------------------

- Allow a bundle to generate outputs that can then feed other aspects of the
  deployment process.

- Allow new functions to actually set timeout, description and memory.

- Fix updating settings on an exising lambda function.

- Automatically remove old versions of lambda functions (that are not aliased
  anywhere).


0.12.0 (2016-06-09)
-------------------

- Add a simple template resource that can be used anywhere a string can be
  used.

- Fix a regression in handling paginated resources that raise errors when no
  resources can be found.


0.11.0 (2016-06-03)
-------------------

- Add support for SSHing into EC2 instances (even going via other EC2 instances
  managed by an autoscaling group).

- Add CloudWatch events. In particular you can now define schedules to drive
  lambda functions.

- Fix support for nested resources in API Gateway.

- Makes `namesapce` a required field on a CloudWatch Alarm.

- Add a max length on the lambda function description field.

- Add support for key filters when setting up S3 notifications.

- S3 ported to use the `annotate_object` API.

- Allow CloudWatch Alarm's to trigger an SNS Topic.

- Fix the describe filters for NAT Gateway (which should let Touchdown actually
  find NAT Gateways now).

- Ignore invalid IP addresses when loading existing IP allocations.

- Don't try and use `sudo` when SSH'd into a node as `root`.

- Fix passing `File` resources to string arguments.

- Only present an SSH agent if a `private_key` is provided.


0.10.2 (2016-05-12)
-------------------

- Fix SSH agent forwarding.


0.10.1 (2016-05-08)
-------------------

- Windows fixes.

- CloudFront compatibility improvements (more resiliant to upstream API changes).


0.10.0 (2016-05-05)
-------------------

- Add support for S3 bucket acceleration.

- Given a dictionary of SSH keys paramiko will now make them available as
  though through agent forwarding.

- Add support for standing up standalone EC2 instances (outside of an ASG).

- Ensure ElastiCache replication group knows its max name length.

- Allow a load balancer to be used as CustomOrigin.

We are now only testing with paramiko 2.0.0 and later. This has dropped
pycrypto in favour of cryptograph (which we already depend on).


0.9.0 (2016-04-19)
------------------

- Touchdown can now manage allocation of parts of a network range through the
  `ip_network` type::

      network = config.add_ip_network(
          name='subnets',
          network='10.41.0.0/20',
      )

      app_serves = network.add_ip_allocation(
          name='app_servers',
          size='25',
      )

  This would allocate the first available `/25` in `10.41.0.0/20`.

- Add support for using the `tail` command against CloudFront distributions.


0.8.0 (2016-03-15)
------------------

- Add support for AWS Lambda security groups and subnets.

- Support propagating tags for autoscaling groups and removing tags from ASG's.

- Fix SSH on newer versions of ubuntu.

- You can now set `evaluate_target_health` on a route53 alias target.

- Support for an 'empty' serializer. Mostly when a field isn't set it shouldn't
  have a value when serialized. CloudFront is an exception.

Touchdown now requires botocore 1.3.26 or higher.


0.7.4 (2016-02-09)
------------------

- Fix problems creating and copying AMI's

This release is tested with botocore 1.3.24.


0.7.3 (2016-02-08)
------------------

- Better diff rendering behaviour when a resource list has an item removed.


0.7.2 (2016-02-05)
------------------

- Fix typo in error message.

- Fix formatting error when diffing JSON payloads (such as for a `user_data`
  attribute on a launch config). In this case the direction of the change could
  be incorrect. (The actual change would be correct, however).


0.7.1 (2016-02-05)
------------------

- Don't try and delete launch configurations that are still in use.

- Better error messages when validating IAM certificate chains.

- Fix compatibility with progressbar2 >= 3.6.0. Previously it would work but
  there were some formatting issues.


0.7.0 (2016-02-02)
------------------

- Support 'update by replacement' for IAM Server Certificates.

- Validates that an IAM Server Certificate `private_key` belongs to its
  `certificate_body`.

- ELB attributes are now part of the load balancer object itself, so::

          aws.add_load_balancer(
              name="my-elb",
              <snip>,
      -       attributes={
      -           "cross_zone_load_balancing": True,
      -            "connection_draining": 30,
      -       },
      +       cross_zone_load_balancing=True,
      +       connection_draining=30,
          )



0.6.1 (2016-01-27)
------------------

- Automatically cast strings to integers when assigning to an
  `argument.Integer`.


0.6.0 (2016-01-26)
------------------

- SSL certificate chains are now validated. This is not yet complete
  verification, but should stop accidentally using entirely the wrong chain for
  your cert.

- CloudFront now supports updates. If you upload a new certificate, your
  CloudFront distribution will be updated accordingly.

- There is now much better diffing when generating plans - you can now diff
  inside JSON blobs specified for autoscaling user data.


0.5.3 (2016-01-19)
------------------

- Allow setting `ssl_policy` on custom origins.

- Allow setting `compress` True/False on a behaviour.


0.5.2 (2016-01-19)
------------------

- Fix network acl entry port validation and allow 'port' to be set to '*'.

- Fix issue updating an Assume Role Policy.

- Fix some issues diffing dicts.


0.5.1 (2016-01-17)
------------------

- Touchdown now reports resource changes better, especially when attributes
  transition from unset to set states.

- Various diffing bug fixes.


0.5.0 (2016-01-15)
------------------

- Add support for AWS NAT Gateway.

- Add support for read and write operations against local files::

    folder = workspace.add_local_folder(name=os.getcwd())
    local_file = folder.add_file(name='production.cfg')

- The contents of any file can be assigned to any string argument. For
  example::

      aws.add_keypair(
          name='my-keypair',
          public_key=folder.add_file(name='production.pub'),
      )

- Add support for GPG encryption. This layers upon the local file system
  abstraction::

    gpg = workspace.add_gpg()
    local_file = gpg.add_cipher(file=local_file)

- Add integration between Amazon KMS and the local file system abstraction::

    kms = aws.add_key(name='my-deployment-key')
    local_file = kms.add_cipher(file=local_file)

- Add support for Amazon KMS Grants.

- Add a ``touchdown edit`` command that can transparently decrypt, fire up
  ``$EDITOR`` and then re-encrypt a file wrapped in GPG or KMS encryption.

- Add a mechanism for ConfParser backed configuration that is mapped to
  touchdowns resource system::

    conf = local_file.add_config()
    asg_min = conf.add_string(
        name='scaling.web.min',
        default=1,
        min=0,
        max=1,
    )

    web_asg = aws.add_auto_scaling_group(
        name='web',
        min=asg_min,
    )

- You can use S3 files anywhere you would use local files::

    bucket = aws.add_bucket(name='mybucket')
    conf = aws.add_config(file=bucket.add_file(name='test.cfg'))

- Add new commands for managing tunable configuration values:

    * ``touchdown get`` - see the current state of a variable
    * ``touchdown set`` - set a new value for a variable
    * ``touchdown refresh`` - reset a variable to its default (can be used to rotate a secret key)

- EC2 KeyPair's can be created from a `private_key` or a `public_key` (in the
  case where a private key is provided touchdown will generate a new public key
  and use that directly). This is to make it easier for the key to be generated
  and rotated by touchdown.


0.4.0 (2016-01-08)
------------------

For end users:

- This release begins to add support for AWS API Gateway. You can create a Rest
  API and attach resources, models, stages, methods and deployments.

- This release begins to add support for AWS Lambda. You can define a callable
  inline in your `Touchdownfile` and have Touchdown manage synchronising it to
  Amazon.

- Touchdown can now configure an SNS Topic to invoke a lambda function.

- Touchdown can now configure S3 notifications to lambda (however filtering is
  not yet supported).

- Lambda permissions are supported and can be managed manually, but S3 will
  automatically be granted suitable access when using bucket notifications.

- Network ACL's are now updated by replacement. Rather than syncing the order
  of the rules, we just create an entirely new ACL and switch subnets to use it.
  This avoids hitting API limits when an ACL with a large number of rules has
  to be reordered. It also makes it easier to switch back to an older ACL if
  something goes wrong with the deployment (as the previous ACL is still
  available).

For developers:

 - There is now a `clean` hook on resources. This allows parameters to be
   massaged before any validation is performed. This is currently used in
   Network ACL's and allows:

     * Creation of a port range from an integer:

         vpc.add_network_acl(
             name='test-acl',
             inbound=[dict(
                network='10.0.0.0/20',
                protocol='tcp',
                port=25,
             )],
         )

     * Or by specifying a start and end of a range:

         vpc.add_network_acl(
             name='test-acl',
             inbound=[dict(
                network='10.0.0.0/20',
                protocol='tcp',
                port__start=8080,
                port__end=8090,
             )],
         )

 - There is a `can_delete` hook for destroyable AWS resources so that resources
   can exclude themsevles from the destroy process.

 - The diffing mechanism has been improved and can now recurse into
   subresources.

 - There are now read-only arguments that calculate their value or return a
   serializer. This allows resources to expose an `arn` parameter consistently.

This release has been tested with `botocore==1.3.12`.


0.3.3 (2015-11-27)
------------------

- Add a timestamp to `touchdown tail foo.log`.


0.3.2 (2015-11-24)
------------------

- Fix CloudFront for new versions of botocore. In the process we now support
  setting the `default_ttl` and `max_ttl`.

- SSH connections will retry more, to give instances time to fully boot.

- Fix ASG SSH behavior. It was supposed to choose a random instance, but was
  actually always picking the first instance.

- Improve Windows support: Avoid using `progressbar2` on Windows. It blows up
  if `signals.SIGWINCH` is not available.

- Add some helpers to resources to help with serializer common cases. For example::

      foo = aws.add_distribution(....)
      bar = foo.identifier()

  Now `bar` is `serializers.Identifier` that is bound to `foo`.


0.3.1 (2015-10-29)
------------------

- Unicode handling fixes in output handlers.


0.3.0 (2015-10-19)
------------------

- Support for notifying NewRelic after a deployment.

- Avoid trying to SSH into terminating instances after an ASG rotation.

- Fix progress bar newline glitches introduced by progressbar2 3.0.


0.2.0 (2015-10-12)
------------------

- Add a new ``touchdown ssh`` and ``touchdown scp`` commands.

- Change how SSH connection to an ASG is achieved (allows private ip addresses
  to be used when on same network, even when using ``.get_auto_scaling_group``.

- The names of resources used when building AMI's are now randomised (which
  should enable parallelism).

- Now uses ``botocore>=1.2.10`` and ``progressbar2>=3.0``.


0.0.31 (2015-09-07)
-------------------

- Fix database rollback.


0.0.30 (2015-09-07)
-------------------

- Add database snapshot goal and command::

    touchdown snapshot DB_NAME SNAPSHOT_NAME


0.0.29 (2015-08-27)
-------------------

- Now requires at least fuselage 0.0.10 to ensure that we don't hit corner
  cases in streaming unicode output from execute resources.

- Simplifies string handling in ssh client to avoid yet more unicode handling
  edge cases.


0.0.28 (2015-08-24)
-------------------

- Support streaming log output to CloudWatch logs instead of (or as well as) the console.

- Output information about remaining tasks so that long running tasks don't
  look like they are hung. This is useful in Travis CI where the silence causes
  builds/deployments to be terminated.

- Better error handling for parallel cases.


0.0.27 (2015-07-31)
-------------------

- Fix planning phase of auto scaling policy creation for empty environments.

- Fix tearing down autoscaling policies.

- Fix tearing down log metric filters.


0.0.26 (2015-07-27)
-------------------

- Add CloudWatch Logs MetricFilter resources. This allows metrics to be
  creating from a log stream.

- Drop the Metric resource.


0.0.25 (2015-07-23)
-------------------

- Fix creating dummy metric.


0.0.24 (2015-07-22)
-------------------

- Fix alarm changes not applying and fix finding alarms when dimensions are involved.

- Wait longer to copy AMI's between regions.


0.0.23 (2015-07-14)
-------------------

- Stop network ACLs applying every time


0.0.22 (2015-06-29)
-------------------

- Add support for ICMP in Network ACLs


0.0.21 (2015-06-26)
-------------------

- Add support for CloudTrail.

- Add support for CloudWatch Alarms.

- Add support for auto scaling policies.

- Override waiters for cloudfront. Double the amount of time we will wait for a
  distributiion to be 'Deployed' as 25 is too low in practice.


0.0.20 (2015-06-23)
-------------------

- More graceful handling of KeyboardInterrupt.

- Fix cache corruption issue.

- Workaround some potential eventual consitency issues with RouteTable and
  NetworkACL. Observed behaviour is that after creating them they arent visible
  to the describe API. Then they are. Then they arent. Then they are.

- Fix the Windows version of the local provider by runnign the bundle under an
  interpreter.


0.0.19 (2015-06-15)
-------------------

- Add AWS password policy management. This lets you enforce password complexity
  for your IAM users.

- Add a 'touchdown get-signin-url' command.

- Better 'touchdown dot' output.

- Fix ``Y/n`` confirmation so that ``Y`` really is the default.

- #43 - Fix documentation and validation around Subnet ``cidr_block`` -
  ``192.168.0.1/24`` isn't a valid cidr.

- A resource acquired with ``Foo.get_bar`` will not be considered for deletion
  by ``touchdown destroy``.


0.0.18 (2015-06-11)
-------------------

- Fix a conflict between IAM policies and Resource policies. Resource policies
  are now specified using ``ensure``::

      aws.add_role(
          name="myrole",
          ensure=["never-destroy"],
          assume_role_policy={...},
          policies={
              "mypolicy": {
                  "Statement": [{
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": "*",
                      "Resource": "*",
                  }],
              },
          },
      )

- Fix a conflict between ``Plan.validate`` and ``Rollback.validate`` which
  caused a regression in the ``rollback`` command.


0.0.17 (2015-06-10)
-------------------

- Fix an edge case where using mfa, cross account roles and image_copy.


0.0.16 (2015-06-10)
-------------------

- Can now do use MFA and cross-account roles to do deployments in other
  accounts. If you set up your Touchdownfile with::

      aws = workspace.add_aws(
          access_key_id="...",
          secret_access_key="...",
          mfa_serial="...",
      )

  Then touchdown will prompt you for an MFA code before starting the
  deployment. Under the hood this uses the ``GetSessionToken`` API to
  generate temporary AWS credentials. A bit like sudo, these are cached
  so each action doesn't require a new MFA token.

- Add a ``pre_restore`` and ``post_restore`` hook to database rollbacks. This
  allows customizations to be run after initial validation but before the
  restore starts. This is great for adding application specific policy like
  emptying an ASG before the rollback.

- Add ASCII table output for price estimation.


0.0.15 (2015-06-03)
-------------------

- asg: If an ASG is connected to an ELB, consider the ELB health when
  scaling/descaling during a deployment.

- Add slack notification support.

- Add basic price estimation.


0.0.14 (2015-05-28)
-------------------

- Add support for AWS CloudWatch Logs. In this initial release you can
  pre-create your log groups and manage the log retention period::

      aws.add_log_group(
          name="application.log",
          retention=3,
      )

- Add a new tail command. This can grab events from any touchdown managed
  CloudWatch log group. For the example above you could get the last 15m of
  logs with::

      touchdown tail application.log -s 15m

  And stream all new logs to that group with::

      touchdown tail application.log -f

- Add a new rollback command. This can restore a snapshot or restore to a point
  in time for any RDS database. For example to rewind your database ``foo`` to
  an hour ago you could::

      touchdown rollback foo 1h

- Both of these commands are written to be pluggable. For example in future you
  might be able to use the same ``tail`` command against a heroku app.

- Touchdown no longer depends on click.


0.0.13 (2015-05-22)
-------------------

- Avoid a case where SSHing into an ASG can actually log into a random instance
  in the cluster. It looks like ``DescribeInstances(InstanceIds=[])`` is
  interpreted as 'any instance'.

- Make sure when bringing up an ASG for the first time it's metadata is updated
  after at least one instance becomes healthy. This avoids cases where the ASG
  looks empty to later steps of the deployment.

- When syncing a folder to S3 use application/octet-stream if unable to guess
  mimetype.


0.0.12 (2015-05-14)
-------------------

- We now use botocore at least 0.107.0. This version changed the structure of
  its metadata folders. In order to continue overriding some values we've had
  to mirror that change, which breaks support for older versions.


0.0.11 (2015-05-14)
-------------------

- The release merges the fuselage integration refactor. You no longer have to
  import bits of fuselage to use it, you can use touchdown serializers and you
  can use it against your local machine. This means you can generate a
  ``local_settings.py`` for your Django dev environment with AWS resource
  details in it!

  A simple example is just::

      from touchdown.core import serializers

      provisioner = workspace.add_fuselage_bundle(
          target=workspace.add_local(),
      )

      provisioner.add_file(
          name="/home/john/hello",
          contents=serializers.Const("HELLO!!"),
      )

  Thanks to @mitchellrj for this feature.

- Print our resource ids after resource creation. This is particularly useful
  for AMI creation and copying.

- Better SSH connection retrying when tunneling.


0.0.10 (2015-05-07)
-------------------

- The parallel resolver introduced in 0.0.7 is now enabled by default.

- We've added more validation! Bucket names are now validated with the same
  rules as the web console. You can only use storage_encrypted with a subset of
  RDS instance sizes. We know capture that before making a single AWS call.

- asg: We now wait for there to be at least one healthy instance when creating
  a new auto scaling group.

- asg: We now clean up old launch configs (you can only create a hundred, and
  with 5 server types you can hit that in 20 deployments!).

- kms: Add initial support for managing Key and Alias resources.

- ssh: Fix streaming from paramiko channels. It was racy, and this meant that
  short lived commands (such as ``whoami``) were prone to not returning all
  their stdout. This mean that our connection health checks would fail.

- ssh: When using ssh-over-ssh the inner connection might fail with
  ChannelException. Assuming that an instance might still be booting we now
  retry in this case.

- elb: Fix failure in elb teardown.

- cloudfront: If resuming a teardown touchdown will now resume waiting for
  web distributions to enter the 'deployed' state before attempting to delete
  them.

- Of interested to developers: we've switched to stricter flake8 settings. We
  are no longer inhibiting any of the default errors. Our ``max-line-length``
  is 150 and our ``max-complexity`` is 11. We will be reducing these further in
  the coming months.


0.0.9 (2015-04-22)
------------------

- s3: Add very basic support for syncing entire folders to s3.

- rds: Add point in time restore and snashot restore.

- cloudfront: By setting cname to '' you can create a alias-less distribution.

- Any field can now accept a serializer. This means any field can be set
  dynamically based on other resources outputs.
  [@mitchellrj]

- We now run our tests on AppVeyor on python 2.7 (32 bit) and python 3.4
  (32 bit and 64 bit).

- elb: Now waits for Elastic Network Interfaces to go away before considering
  an elb deleted.


0.0.8 (2015-03-26)
------------------

- The s3 describe step now retrieves the location a bucket was created in.

- S3 buckets are now created with a LocationConstraint based on the account
  resource. For example::

      aws = workspace.add_aws(region='eu-central-1')
      aws.add_bucket(name='my-bucket')

  Will now create the bucket in eu-central-1, like you would expect.

- Add's support for copying images created with ``add_image`` to other regions.


0.0.7 (2015-03-23)
------------------

- Add an experimental threaded resolver for deploying infrastructure in
  parallel. If you are using the command line tool you can pass
  ``--parallel``::

    touchdown --parallel apply

  Users consuming the python API can switch from the ``Runner`` class to
  ``ThreadedRunner``.

- StreamingDistribution should now work. It's API has been simplified too. You
  can set one up with::

      aws.add_streaming_distribution(
          name="streaming.example.com",
          bucket=mybucket,
      )

  Where ``mybucket`` was previously defined with ``aws.add_bucket``.

- You can now create ``ALIAS`` records for Distribution and
  StreamingDistribution resources::

      aws.add_hosted_zone(
          name="example.com",
          records=[
              {"name": "backend",   "type": "A", "alias": my_load_balancer},
              {"name": "www",       "type": "A", "alias": my_distribution},
              {"name": "streaming", "type": "A", "alias": my_streaming_distribution},
          ],
      )

- You can now set CORS and policy for S3 buckets. You can also do simple file
  uploads with the new file resource::

      bucket = aws.add_bucket(name="my-test-bucket")
      bucket.add_file(
          name="crossdomain.xml",
          contents=open("crossdomain.xml").read(),
      )

  You can set canned ACL's on the files as well.

- You can now set the ``origin_path`` attribute of CloudFront.

- Improved python 3 support.


0.0.6 (2015-03-04)
------------------

- Fix python 3 release.


0.0.5 (2015-03-04)
------------------

- More useful/verbose console output.

- Timeouts when operations take longer than expected are handled more
  gracefully. Fixes #6.

- The dependency solver now sorts within batches, fixing #4.


0.0.4 (2015-02-26)
------------------

- Brown paper bag.


0.0.3 (2015-02-26)
------------------

- The CloudFront abstraction has been revisited to flatten and simplify the
  structure (as the actual payload for CloudFront is quite complicated). The
  docs have been updated accordingly.

- Tearing down a CloudFront distribution now correctly refreshes the ETag after
  disabling a distribution, allowing it to suceed.

- The VPN Gateway handling has been improved. They are now correctly attached
  and detached from a VPC when creating and destroying them.


0.0.2 (2015-02-18)
------------------

- Basic support for Amazon SQS.

- Basic support for Amazon SNS.

- Basic support for Amazon CloudFront Streaming Distributions.

- Pipeline sbould now be able to create one.

- Strings fields are now validated against their annotations:

    * `min` enforces a minimum length for a value
    * `max` enforces a maximum length for a value
    * `choices` enforces that the value is one of a pre-determined list
    * `regex` enforces that the value matches a guard expression

- More types now have proper ``signature`` annotations for their ``Apply``
  policy. For example, you will now be warned at plan time if a
  SecurityGroup doesn't have the required ``description`` field (#10).
